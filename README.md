## Updates
* [2023.08.01] 
  * Update Codex to ChatGPT.
  * Add Java JDK8 installation guideline required by MineDojo.
* [2023.03.28] Due to the cancellation of access to Codex by OpenAI, planning based on Codex is no longer supported by this repository. We will update to the latest OpenAI model, ChatGPT, which has better performance, as soon as possible.

## Prepare Packages
Our codebase require Python â‰¥ 3.9. 
Please run the following commands to prepare the environments. 
```sh
conda create -n planner python=3.9 
conda activate planner
python -m pip install numpy torch==2.0.0.dev20230208+cu117 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cu117
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m pip install git+https://github.com/MineDojo/MineCLIP
```

## Prepare Environment

It also requires a [modified version of MineDojo](https://github.com/CraftJarvis/MC-Simulator) as the simulator and a [goal-conditioned controller](https://github.com/CraftJarvis/MC-Controller). 
```sh
git clone https://github.com/CraftJarvis/MC-Simulator.git
cd MC-Simulator
pip install -e .
```

> The following is from the official docs of MineDojo.

Java JDK 8 is required to support the backend of MineDojo. To install JDK 8 on Ubuntu 20.04, you can run the following command:
```
apt update -y && apt install -y software-properties-common && \
    add-apt-repository ppa:openjdk-r/ppa && apt update -y && \
    apt install -y openjdk-8-jdk
```
After installing Java JDK 8, in case your Ubuntu comes with pre-installed Java, you may need to run the following code to switch default Java version:
```
sudo update-alternatives --config java
```
Note that if your machine is headless, for example a VM on Google Cloud Platform, you need to use a software renderer such as xvfb such that our codebase can work properly. To install xvfb and other dependencies, run
```
sudo apt install xvfb xserver-xephyr vnc4server python-opengl ffmpeg
```

To run with xvfb, you can either prepend xvfb-run to commands running Python scripts, or set environment variable MINEDOJO_HEADLESS=1. The code block below demonstrates these two options.
```
xvfb-run python path/to/minedojo/python/scripts.py

MINEDOJO_HEADLESS=1 python path/to/minedojo/python/scripts.py
```

## Prepare controller checkpoints

Below are the configures and weights of models.

|---|---|---|---|

## Prepare OpenAI keys
Our planner depends on Large Language Model like InstructGPT, Codex or ChatGPT. So we need support the OpenAI keys in the file `data/openai_keys.txt`. An OpenAI key list is also accepted.

## Running agent models
To run the code, call 
```sh
python main.py model.load_ckpt_path=<path/to/ckpt>
```
After loading, you should see a window where agents are playing Minecraft.

Note: Our planner depends on stable OpenAI API connection. If meeting connection error, please retry it.
